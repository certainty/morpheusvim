# Morpheus NVIM

This is my neovim configuration which I started with the awesome kickstart.nvim packaged and configured it to what I need.

## Decisions

1. Limit the number of plugins to the ones I really need
2. Keybindings are only used for the most commonly used commands (the rest will be done via the command bar)
3. SPC = Leader
4. , = LocalLeader
